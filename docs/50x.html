<h1>Oops, there was a little accident...</h1>

<blockquote>
	<p>Sorry about this ladies and gentlemen - there has been a little accident.</p>
    
    <p>I no longer have any idea about who I am, where I am or what I was doing.</p>
   
    <p>I am trying to recover as soon as possible, so please come back later and celebrate my return to health!</p>

    <p>Thank you for your well wishes! (no, there is no need to send flowers or gifts!)</p>
